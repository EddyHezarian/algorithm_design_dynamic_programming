It is obvious that the distance of each stop is sometimes different from the previous origin. Also, each stop has several accommodations with different accommodation rates. Considering that according to the estimate, every kilometer will bring depreciation cost of 50 dollars for the cyclist, so the cyclist prefers to travel the route in such a way that the total cost of depreciation and accommodation costs during The path is the lowest possible value. Write a program that receives the number of stopping stages, the number of stopping places in each stage, the distances and the cost of accommodation in the accommodation of each stop, and using the dynamic planning method, the lowest total cost of depreciation and accommodation, as well as a route which produces the minimum value to obtain Suppose the destination is the last stage of the stop, which itself has different stops with different accommodations.
